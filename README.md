# college-finder-by-interest

This is a small website I built to help high school students explore college options based on their interests.

## How it works

You pick an interest (like law, coding, etc.), and the site gives you a list of related majors along with some recommended colleges.

## Why I made this

I'm still learning to code and wanted to build something fun and useful.

## Tools I used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

## Live version

## Things I might improve later

- Add more interests  
- Connect it to real college databases

## Feedback

Open to feedback and improvements â€” still figuring things out, so suggestions are always welcome!
